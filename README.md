<body>
	<h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
	<p>This is a basic webpage created using HTML.</p>

Save this code in a file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `mywebpage.html`) and open it in a web browser to see the result.

Would you like me to add any specific features to this webpage, such as:

1. Images
2. Links
3. Tables
4. Forms
5. CSS styling
